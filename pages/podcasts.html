      <h3><b>NUTMEG BOYS: THE REVIEW IS FINALLY HERE</b></h3>
      <h5>Are these boys the next big thing, or should they be roasted on an open fire like the rest? <span class="w3-opacity">October 4, 2021</span></h5>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>In this day and age, podcasts have taken the world by storm. Across the globe, people are picking up their microphones and taking to the airwaves, highlighting the ever-shifting landscape of how we consume media. In the sea of celebrity cash grabs and DnD adventures now dominating the charts, a new podcast seeks to find its spot atop the mountain. Let me introduce you to the Nutmeg Boys.
        <br/><br/>
        Jake Tucker and David Sandor are a pair of high school and college buddies hailing from the Nutmeg State itself, the namesake of their new show. Born and raised in the rolling plains and along the beautiful shores of Connecticut, their small-town nature shines through amidst slightly garbled audio quality and the occasional hungover groan.
        <br/><br/>
        I suppose the audio quality ought to be addressed first, as it is what you notice immediately upon hitting play. The boys clearly are still testing the waters of the podcasting world, and they even admit that laying across from each other with a phone sitting on a table in between is not the ideal setup. Should they wish to survive in this veritable battle royale of audio entertainment, a mic or two certainly wouldn't hurt their chances.
        <br/><br/>
        The content, on the other hand, is anything but low quality. In the all too brief 17 minute runtime, the two discuss subjects ranging from television and literature to drug dealers and health & wellness, all the while making each other, and the audience, laugh along. Jake and David have a great rapport and a sense of dry, casual comedy, and it comes across well.
        <br/><br/>
        The premise of the two recovering from the previous night's escapades also lends itself to this type of content, as the image it paints creates a cozy, relaxing atmosphere. The podcast is easy listening and would pair perfectly with the type of hangover they are experiencing. As a journalist possessed with almost impeccable genetics and therefore unable to get hangovers, I was still able to put myself in their shoes, almost as if I was right there with them.
        <br/><br/>
        The hosts also have a healthy contrast in their views on certain topics, highlighted by the Breaking Bad discussion. This dynamic serves to heighten the listening experience and gives the chance for the audience to weigh in and interact with the show. I, for one, almost wholeheartedly agreed with everything that Jake was saying about Breaking Bad. If the boys happen to stumble upon this article, next time I hope to hear their thoughts on Better Call Saul.
        <br/><br/>
        When the show came to an end I found myself eager to hear the next chapter. I still want to know what their night was like that led them to this recording, an intriguing hook that they set which effectively roped me in. Though they've got a ways to go, I think that with a little added salt the Nutmeg Boys might just have a shot at claiming fame amongst the podcasting elite.
