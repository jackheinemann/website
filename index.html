  <p class="about-paragraph">I am a freelance software engineer who is passionate about creating functional and elegant tools that present seamlessly to the end user. I enjoy developing for mobile primarily, but I have worked in many different environments and am always on the lookout for whatever framework best suits the task at hand. An idea for a new piece of software is an exciting challenge to me, and I love digging through my mental toolbox to tackle the variety of personal and professional projects I work on.</p>

      <p>Otlet is an app I created to take over for the shoddy Excel spreadsheet that I was using to track my book reading habits. The app allows the user to add books with custom info, ISBN lookup, or by querying the OpenLibrary API by book title. It then lets you log reading sessions, organize your books into collections, and other similar "book app" capabilities. The real reason I made the app, however, is the tools and charting system, which lets a user set custom metrics (such as Book Recommender, Reading Session Location, Cover Rating, etc.), track them across books, then present them in a chart of their choice.</p>

      <h4>Beacon Marina Manager</h4>
      <p>An app I made for a client to bring together various services that were previously unintegrated for their customers. In developing this all-in-one style product, I sought out and combined many different general networking solutions and proprietary APIs, each in a drastically different state of documentation. The app handles functions such as downloading and displaying files and folders, recursively iterating through trees of document storage, remotely accessing and interacting with hardware in real time, and maintaining reasonable local storage for session continuity.</p>

      <h4>Balderdash io</h4>
      <p>This was a web app I built to facilitate my friends and I playing an old game called Balderdash. The gist of the game is that everyone has to submit answers to certain prompts, and one person has to read this all out, which we traditionally accomplished with ripped up pieces of paper and pens. To avoid the unending loose scraps of paper showing up all over the house, I decided to make this. The app runs through each round of the game just as we would in real life, allowing users to enter their names, see the prompts, and submit answers in a realtime lobby. At the end of each round, users are able to submit their votes, which are tallied and converted to points, all of which is maintained in the database. The biggest challenge with this project was developing what was essentially a basic game server and seamlessly integrating all of my friends' web browsers into its game loop.</p>

      <a href="https://pypi.org/project/nasspython/"><h4>NASS API Python Wrapper</h4></a>
      <p>This is a Python package I made when I was working with National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) data in an attempt to build an algorithm to predict the prices of cattle futures. When working with the API I found a wrapper written in R, which looked like it greatly simplified the process. As I was using Python for my project, I decided to make a version of the wrapper for myself. It allowed me to easily query the massive NASS database for the data I wanted, and automate the process to integrate with my other data processing I had operating alongside it.</p>

      <h4>Jeopardy Buzzer System</h4>
      <p>This was a very simple and quickly put together project I made for a game of custom jeopardy my friends and I were preparing to play. As one of the people creating and running the game, I decided to make a barebones web app that would let the players hit a "buzzer" displayed on their mobile browser which would then send me their names and buzz order to my admin console. It was probably the most "spaghetti code" piece of software I've made, but it was certainly a valuable learning experience and a working web app by the time jeopardy night came around.</p>
