    <h3>Otlet</h3>
    <p>This is an app I made when I set a goal to read 26 books in 2021. I wanted to track certain metrics and graph them as time went by, so I could see random stats like what percent of my books are recommended by my friend Jake or the breakdown of where I spent each reading session for a particular genre. It took longer than I thought.</p>
